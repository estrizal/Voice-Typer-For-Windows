# Voice-Typer-For-Windows
Made in python. This project converts speech into text and pastes directly into the text fields in which you are working on. It can type in multiple languages. I have made an exe file of this project which you can download at https://sites.google.com/view/estriadi-portfolio-1/home 


It is an extremely messy code, because I never thought I will ever share it anywhere. Pull requests are much appriciated. It uses pyqt5 for User Interface, Speech Recognition library for Speech to text conversion, pyautoGUI for pasting and firebase for updating the app if an update was uploaded by me on my firebase.
